Small Scale Restaurant Management System Restaurant DMBS

While we were studying SQL fundamentals, a friend of mine and I created the above project. The project assists small-scale restaurants in tracking which orders are taken by whom, on what day, at which table, at what time, and so on. Customers have the option of selecting their dishes from our website and deleting any item if necessary. Every order is assigned to a different waiter and chef in a round-robin way. The restaurant's manager can quickly add a new item to the menu as well. Customers can provide feedback on our websites as well.
